## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Kigali_Traffic_App.git
cd Kigali_Traffic_App
```

### 2. Google Maps API Key
This app uses Google Maps JavaScript API. You need to provide your own API key:

- Open `index.html` and `issue-report.html`.
- Replace the value of `key=YOUR_API_KEY` in the `<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?...">` tag with your actual Google Maps API key.

Example:
```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places&callback=initMap" async defer></script>
```

### 3. Run the App
This is a static frontend app. You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, or use a local server for best results:

#### Using VSCode Live Server Extension
- Right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.
