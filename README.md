## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Kigali_Traffic_App.git
cd Kigali_Traffic_App
```

### 2. Google Maps API Key
This app uses Google Maps JavaScript API. You need to provide your own API key:

- Open `index.html` and `issue-report.html`.
- Replace the value of `key=YOUR_API_KEY` in the `<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?...">` tag with your actual Google Maps API key.

Example:
```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places&callback=initMap" async defer></script>
```

### 3. Run the App
This is a static frontend app. You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, or use a local server for best results:

#### Using VSCode Live Server Extension
- Right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.

### 4. Deploy with GitHub Pages
This app is deployed at **[https://hirwacedric123.github.io/traffic_system/](https://hirwacedric123.github.io/traffic_system/)**.

To enable or update the deployment:
1. Go to your repo **Settings** → **Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Select branch **main** and folder **/ (root)**, then **Save**.
4. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), add `https://hirwacedric123.github.io/*` to your API key’s **HTTP referrers** so the map works on the live site.

### 5. Deploy with Netlify
The project includes a `netlify.toml` config for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

**Option A – Connect GitHub (recommended, auto-deploys on push):**
1. Sign in at [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/) with GitHub.
2. Click **Add new site** → **Import an existing project**.
3. Choose **GitHub** and authorize Netlify, then select the **hirwacedric123/traffic_system** repo.
4. Netlify will detect the config: **Build command** can stay empty, **Publish directory** is `.` (from `netlify.toml`).
5. Click **Deploy site**. Your site will be at `https://<random-name>.netlify.app` (you can change it in **Site settings** → **Domain management**).
6. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), add `https://*.netlify.app/*` (or your exact site URL) to your Maps API key’s **HTTP referrers**.

**Option B – Deploy from CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify init   # link to a new or existing site
netlify deploy --prod
```
